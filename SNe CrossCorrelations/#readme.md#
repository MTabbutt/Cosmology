# SNe CrossCorrelations Overview:


<Strong> <em> Project Summary: </Strong> </em> We are investigating the Mukherjee and Wandelt (2018) Paper: <em> Beyond the classical distance-redshift test: cross-correlating redshift-free standard candles and sirens with redshift surveys </em>. The proposal of the paper is to use cross correlations of Supernova (without red shift information) and galaxy surveys (with redshift information) to constrain cosmological parameters. The article suggests a greatly improved constraint with this new method. Our first goal is to use the method proposed on data from EBOSS and PanSTARRS. Ultimatly we want to verify the improved constraint ourselves and explore applications to future surveys such as LSST.
