Created Running notes file for tracking details about this run and products produced/saved
 
0. Define the Queries you want to run and write and randoms length:
 
randsLength for PanSTARRS: 100000
 
qry_PanSTARRS_Data_All 
SELECT ID, DEC, RA, zSN, zHost FROM PanSTARRSNEW WHERE (zSN > -999) || (zHost > -999)
 
qry_BOSS_Data_SouthAndNorthALL 
SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_South UNION SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_North
 
qry_BOSS_Rands_SouthAndNorthLimit 
SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_South_rands 
    WHERE `index` IN (SELECT `index`FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_South_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000) UNION 
    SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_North_rands 
    WHERE `index`  IN (SELECT `index` FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_North_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000)
 
1. Pull in and parse data
 
PanSTARRSNEW_GoodZ Database (with 10 pointings) objects: 1129
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF Database objects: 1325856
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF_rands Database objects: 10000
 
2. Create the TreeCorr Catalogs of Data:
 
Created cat_PanSTARRS_Full.
 
3. Create the randoms for PanSTARRS. Include all 10 pointings, delete MD02 later.
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS data and randoms
 
Populated pointings with randoms. Randoms per pointing: (1, 3-10, 2):[40, 29, 36, 32, 28, 31, 45, 32, 31, 31]
 
4. Make PanSTARRS Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS Auto-Corr with PanSTARRS randoms
 
4. Make CMASS&LOWZ Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
5. Make CMASS&LOWZ Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Created cat_BOSS.
 
Created cat_BOSS & cat_rand_BOSS.
 
5. Make CMASS&LOWZ Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
5.1 BOSS total AutoCorrelation Function
 
Plotted: CMASS_LOWZ Data and Randoms
 
Plotted: BOSS Auto Corr with BOSS randoms
