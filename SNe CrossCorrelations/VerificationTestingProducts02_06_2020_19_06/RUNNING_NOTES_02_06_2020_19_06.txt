0. Pull in and parse data:
 
PanSTARRSNEW_GoodZ Database (with 10 pointings) objects: 1129
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF Database objects: 1325856
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF_rands Database objects: 1000
 
1. Create the TreeCorr Catalogs of Data:
 
Created cat_PanSTARRS_Full.
 
2. Create the randoms for PanSTARRS. Include all 10 pointings, delete MD02 later.
 
randsLength: 10000
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS data and randoms
 
Populated pointings with randoms. Randoms per pointing: (1, 3-10, 2):[1, 2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 1, 6, 6, 5]
 
3. Make PanSTARRS Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS Auto-Corr with PanSTARRS randoms
 
4. Make CMASS Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Created cat_eBOSS.
 
Plotted: CMASS_LOWZ Randoms
 
Plotted: eBOSS Auto Corr with eBOSS randoms
 
5. Analyze if the plots are correct:
