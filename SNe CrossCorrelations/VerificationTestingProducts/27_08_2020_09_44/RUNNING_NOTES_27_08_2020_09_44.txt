Created Running notes file for tracking details about this run and products produced/saved
 
0. Define the Queries you want to run and write and randoms length:
 
randsLength for PanSTARRS: 100000000
 
qry_PanSTARRS_Data_All 
SELECT ID, DEC, RA, zSN, zHost FROM PanSTARRSNEW WHERE (zSN > -999) || (zHost > -999)
 
qry_PanSTARRS_Data_Overlap 
SELECT ID, DEC, RA, zSN, zHost FROM PanSTARRSNEW WHERE (DEC > -20) 
    AND ((zSN > -999) OR (zHost > -999))
 
1. Pull in and parse data
 
PanSTARRSNEW_GoodZ Database (with 10 pointings) objects: 1129
 
2. Create the TreeCorr Catalogs of Data:
 
Created cat_PanSTARRS_Full.
 
3. Create the randoms for PanSTARRS. Include all 10 pointings, delete MD02 later.
 
Populated pointings with randoms. Randoms per pointing: (1, 3-10, 2):[33924, 34503, 35141, 33445, 34413, 34692, 34594, 34405, 32674, 31902]
 
4. Make PanSTARRS Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS Auto-Corr with PanSTARRS randoms
 
Creating save file with plot data:
