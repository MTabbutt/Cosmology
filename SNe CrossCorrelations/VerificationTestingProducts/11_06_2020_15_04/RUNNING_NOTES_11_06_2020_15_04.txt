Created Running notes file for tracking details about this run and products produced/saved
 
0. Pull in and parse data:
 
PanSTARRSNEW_GoodZ Database (with 10 pointings) objects: 1129
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF Database objects: 1325856
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF_rands Database objects: 100000
 
1. Create the TreeCorr Catalogs of Data:
 
Created cat_PanSTARRS_Full.
 
2. Create the randoms for PanSTARRS. Include all 10 pointings, delete MD02 later.
 
randsLength: 1000000
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS data and randoms
 
Populated pointings with randoms. Randoms per pointing: (1, 3-10, 2):[321, 258, 340, 169, 251, 210, 204, 350, 352, 264]
 
3. Make PanSTARRS Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS Auto-Corr with PanSTARRS randoms
 
4. Make CMASS Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Created cat_eBOSS.
 
Plotted: CMASS_LOWZ Randoms
 
Plotted: eBOSS Auto Corr with eBOSS randoms
 
5. Analyze if the plots are correct:
 
5.1 Auto Correlate the CMASS and LOWZ randoms:
 
CMASS_DF_rands Database objects: 100000
 
LOWZ_DF_rands Database objects: 100000
 
Plotted: CMASS and LOWZ randoms
 
Plotted: CMASS_rands Auto Corr with LOWZ_rands as randoms
 
5.2 Auto Correlate the CMASS and LOWZ randoms - Reversed:
 
Plotted: LOWZ_rands Auto Corr with CMASS_rands as randoms
 
6. Cross Correlate the eBOSS and PanSTARRS sets
 
Populated pointings with randoms. Randoms per pointing: (1, 3-10, 2):[321, 258, 340, 169, 251, 210, 204, 350, 352]
 
PanSTARRSNEW_GoodZ_ovelap Database (with 9 pointings) objects: 1058
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS cross Correlation with eBOSS
 
5.3 Auto Correlate CMASS randoms and CMASS randoms:
 
CMASS_DF_rands_Sample1 Database objects: 100000
 
CMASS_DF_rands_Sample2 Database objects: 100000
 
Plotted: CMASS and CMASS randoms
 
Plotted: CMASS_rands Auto Corr with CMASS_rands as randoms
 
5.3 Auto Correlate LOWZ randoms and LOWZ randoms:
 
LOWZ_DF_rands_Sample1 Database objects: 100000
 
LOWZ_DF_rands_Sample2 Database objects: 100000
 
Plotted: LOWZ and LOWZ randoms
 
Plotted: LOWZ_rands Auto Corr with LOWZ_rands as randoms
 
Program is done.
