** So many issues with basemaps... **

Verison 1 of what the fix was in the end with hints from people online:

- Install on a fresh environment, if install in root, var path issues
- First updates matplotlib on root
- So I installed on ccl environment with no basemaps ever installed
- conda install basemap
- here is the code to import and set path: 
>>> import mpl_toolkits
>>> mpl_toolkits.__path__.append('//miniconda3/envs/ccl/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/')
>>> from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

- had a lot of issues finding this path, but stole it from a warning that a different code shot me that
  pointed me to where the mpl_toolkits was installed. Good to note. Was thinking it was in //miniconda3/pkgs. 
  (maybe for root that is true?)
