Notes about this specific run: 1st python test worked, trying again with larger data set. 
 
0. Define the Queries you want to run and write and randoms length:
 
randsLength for PanSTARRS: 10000000
 
qry_PanSTARRS_Data_All 
SELECT ID, DEC, RA, zSN, zHost FROM PanSTARRSNEW WHERE (zSN > -999) || (zHost > -999)
 
qry_PanSTARRS_Data_Overlap 
SELECT ID, DEC, RA, zSN, zHost FROM PanSTARRSNEW WHERE (DEC > -20) 
    AND ((zSN > -999) OR (zHost > -999))
 
qry_BOSS_Data_SouthAndNorthALL 
SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_South UNION SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_North
 
qry_BOSS_Rands_SouthAndNorthLimit 
SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_South_rands 
    WHERE `index` IN (SELECT `index`FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_South_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000000) UNION 
    SELECT * FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_North_rands 
    WHERE `index`  IN (SELECT `index` FROM CMASSLOWZTOT_North_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000000)
 
qry_CMASS_Rands_SampleLimit 
SELECT * FROM CMASS_South_rands 
    WHERE `index` IN (SELECT `index` FROM CMASS_South_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000000) UNION 
    SELECT * FROM CMASS_North_rands WHERE 
    `index` IN (SELECT `index` FROM CMASS_North_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000000)
 
qry_LOWZ_Rands_SampleLimit 
SELECT * FROM LOWZ_South_rands 
    WHERE `index` IN (SELECT `index` FROM LOWZ_South_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000000) UNION 
    SELECT * FROM LOWZ_North_rands WHERE 
    `index` IN (SELECT `index` FROM LOWZ_North_rands ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5000000)
 
1. Pull in and parse data
 
PanSTARRSNEW_GoodZ Database (with 10 pointings) objects: 1129
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF Database objects: 1325856
 
CMASSLOWZTOT_DF_rands Database objects: 10000000
 
2. Create the TreeCorr Catalogs of Data:
 
Created cat_PanSTARRS_Full.
 
3. Create the randoms for PanSTARRS. Include all 10 pointings, delete MD02 later.
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS data and randoms
 
Populated pointings with randoms. Randoms per pointing: (1, 3-10, 2):[3341, 3476, 3468, 3308, 3453, 3459, 3587, 3508, 3370, 3283]
 
4. Make PanSTARRS Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS Auto-Corr with PanSTARRS randoms
 
5. Make CMASS&LOWZ Count-Count Auto Correlation Functions:
 
5.1 BOSS total AutoCorrelation Function
 
Created cat_BOSS & cat_rand_BOSS.
 
6. Cross Correlate the BOSS and PanSTARRS sets
 
Populated pointings with randoms. Randoms per pointing: (1, 3-10):[3341, 3476, 3468, 3308, 3453, 3459, 3587, 3508, 3370]
 
PanSTARRSNEW_GoodZ_ovelap Database (with 9 pointings) objects: 1058
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS cross Correlation with BOSS
 
Plotted: PanSTARRS cross Correlation with BOSS no error
